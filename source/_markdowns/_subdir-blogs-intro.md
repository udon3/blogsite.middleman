## Blog intro

New blogs added by simple creating MarkDown content in an appropriate year folder in `/subdir/blog/` directory.

If changing the location of the blog folder, be sure to update the `config.rb`, in the  `activate :blog` block.

Blog pages are built using  the `post.haml` template (in `/source/_templates/layouts/`)

Tags and Category pages are dynamically built using the respective templates (in `source` root).
