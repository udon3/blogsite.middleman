This is a subdirectory with two sample sections (just single pages) and a blog section.

All pages in this section have a subnavigation (in form of a sidebar) and look like they use the same template, but they don't.

Blog pages use the `post.haml` template, and the other 'ordinary' pages use `master.haml`. (I'd had a few problems when setting up - may be time to revisit and see about rectifying?)
